Pocket Philosopher
==================

An App which saves, retrieves, edits and displays **aphorisms**.

What is an Aphorism?
--------------------

- An aphorism is an original thought, spoken or written in a laconic (concise) and memorable form. (Wikipedia)
- a short pithy saying expressing a general truth; maxim (Collins English Dictionary)
- a terse saying embodying a general truth or astute observation, as “Art is long, life is short.” (Webster's College Dictionary)

Background Images
-----------------
By default the application will use /sdcard/DCIM or /sdcard/Pictures to find images for the background.
If you use the Download Background Images feature, the file at the URL is just a plain text with a list of
URLs, one-per-line pointing to where to get the images to download from.  If the images are in the same folder
as the text file, you can just put the name of the file within the same folder instead of a full URL.

Database Import/Export
----------------------
The database is exported to a file "aphorisms-YYYYMM-DD-HHMMSS.json" and this file can be imported directly or put at a URL to download aphorisms remotely.
