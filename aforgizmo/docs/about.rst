Version 1
---------
The project codename is *aforgizmo* based on the words *aphorism* and *gizmo*,
in that this is a tool originally envisioned to maintain and display a
database of aphorisms.

**DISCLAIMER** I provide this app free-of-charge and as-is with no implied
blah blah blah, if you like it and would like to support my hard effort, I'd
gladly accept a donation towards my cycling trip and drinking funds by PayPal.
